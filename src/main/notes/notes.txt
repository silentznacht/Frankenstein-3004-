What are swerve modules?
    Each swerve module has two motors in our case Krakens so TalonFX
    One controls how fast the wheel spins. While the other controls 
    the angle of the wheel.We can drive forward, sideways or rotate in 
    place or moving around while spinning. On GamePad one stick controls 
    moving around, while the other controls spinning. Inputs in joystick X, 
    Y and turning direction.

Swerve Module State - The speed and direction a module should be in

How to Decide Motor Output? 
    How are motor outputs decided, if our robot has physical max speed of 5 meters per second then we divide the incoming speed value by 5

How to Get Angle? 
    For the angle, we use a PID controller to drive the motor to the requested set point

Why Absolute Analog?
    When ever the robot turns off the motors and encoders lose their previous readings, but 
    the Absolute Analog encoders permantly knows the robots location, to help figure out 
    where the wheels are facing

    They are connected to the analog imports on the robo rio

    private final boolean abosoluteEncoderReversed;
    private final double abosoluteEncoderOffsetRad;

    are both used to read how much wheels are  off by to compensate in the code later
